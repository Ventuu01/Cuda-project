## Project Overview
This project implements and compares a CPU and two CUDA-based implementations
of the Sobel edge detection algorithm.

## Directory description
**cpu/**  
contains the sequential CPU implementation of the Sobel and Blue filters.
The folder includes the source files and the compiled executable (**`sobel_cpu.exe`**), which processes images from the input dataset (data/input/dataset/) and stores the results in data/output/cpu/.

**cuda/**  
Contains the CUDA implementations of the Sobel and Blue filters and also the **.exe files**:
- sobel_cuda.cu and **`sobel_cuda.exe`**: naive CUDA implementation
- sobel_cuda_shared.cu and **`sobel_cuda_shared.exe`**: shared-memory optimized implementation
Each source file has a corresponding executable that writes output images to its dedicated output directory under data/output/.

**data/input/**  
Contains the input image datasets (data/input/dataset) used for testing and performance evaluation. Images must be in PPM (P3) format.

**data/output/**  
Stores all images generated by the CPU and CUDA implementations (now thay are empty):
- cpu/: output from the CPU executable
- sobel_naive/: output from the CUDA naive implementation
- sobel_shared/: output from the CUDA shared-memory implementation

**data/output/converted_images/**  
Contains PNG versions of all output images. The directory structure mirrors that of data/output/ and is generated using the conversion script Convert_to_png.py.

**Conversion Scripts**  
- Convert_to_ppm_p3.py --> converts input images (es. JPG or PNG) to the PPM (P3) format required by the executables.
- Convert_to_png.py --> converts all generated PPM output images to PNG format while preserving the
directory structure.
